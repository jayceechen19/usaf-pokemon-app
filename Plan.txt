// DOM RENDERS

1. As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific Pokemon so that I can see all of the important/relevant information about them.

// Form where user makes API request to pokeapi for specific pokemon, returns info

2. As a user (who is new to Pokemon and doesn’t know any names to search!), I want to click on a “View All” (or similar) button and look at page with pictures of all the pokemon so that I can click on the picture and learn more about them! 

// API Request for all Pokemon; https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{num < 964}
// For each pokemon display sprite on page: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/27.png
        {sprite}.back_default
        Make a button wrapper w/ img

3. As a user I want to click on a “View similar types” button for a specific pokemon and I will see a list of other pokemon with the same type.
4. As a user, I want each Pokemon to have a  “collect” feature so that I can add it to my collection if I like it.
5. As a user, I want to have a “view collection” feature so that I can view my whole collection at any time 
6. As a user, I want there to be a “battle” feature where I can see who would win between two Pokemon  (here, you can select two Pokemon and have them battle, and based on some criteria, you determine the winner)
7. As a user, I want there to be a “Grocery List” feature that tells me all the foods I need to buy when I go to the store so that I can feed my Pokemon!
